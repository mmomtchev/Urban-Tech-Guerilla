# Urban Tech Guerilla

## Dedication

I dedicate the *Urban Tech Guerilla* to Ernesto "Che" Guevara.

Despite having wildly different political ideas, Che has always been an inspiration to me.

A determined fighter who never gave up on liberty, Che has become a symbol of political activism.

Just as his guide inspired people around the world, and as a symbol of political pluralism, I will be writing this new guide, updated for the modern world, for everyone who fights for whatever cause he finds righteous. Because everyone who is willing to sacrifice personal comfort for a cause is worthy of my help.

## Everyday life

Living the Jason Bourne lifestyle is usually much exciting than in the movies. You will be spending large amounts of time on the lookout for many basic necessities that average people take for granted. A place to spend the night, food, water, electricity - nothing will come to you without some effort.

#### Keeping your physical location secret and using the Internet

There are two main ways to access the Internet anonymously:
 - dedicated data-only burner SIM cards that can be bought with crypto currencies
 - wardriving and using public Wi-Fi hotspots

SIM cards offer the best mobility, but you should know that many EU countries severely restrict burner SIM cards - including France where this guide is currently being written. These are still available, but the cost is usually higher since you will have to be in roaming mode.

Wardriving for public Wi-Fi hotspots should work very well in every large metropolitan area. These days there are so many of them that usually you will be looking for a good parking place first, and then for a Wi-Fi hotspot.

I will be writing a separate tutorial for the wardriving setup itself.

You should avoid residential Wi-Fi APs. Even when these are open, they tend to be lower-end lower-power WiFi APs. Professional APs are made to cover large areas and are installed by professionals who know how to place the antennas to achieve the best coverage possible. These are found in most big retail stores, hotels, restaurants, bars, parks, universities, schools, hospitals, conference halls and everywhere where many people tend to come. These public APs will sometimes have restrictions, but Tor can be made to work on any network that allows HTTP(S) access (albeit somewhat slower than on a completely unrestricted network). It is purposely made to be difficult to detect.

Another excellent choice are the corporate APs for visitors. Most large office buildings will have a free AP for business visitors. These tend to offer very good Internet access with few restrictions since the business visitors are supposed to be able to connect to their own corporate VPN networks - which is essentially what you will be doing too.

In the addendum, you will find a tutorial for installing a dedicated Linux Tor router with a firewall using a virtual machine (the current version supports only macOS since this is what I am using, but this is possible on all OS).

## Addendum

### Practical Guides

An early draft for a guide on how to make untraceable Internet connections using public Wi-Fi APs. I will certainly try to make it accessible to the average layman.
