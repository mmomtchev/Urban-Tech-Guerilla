# Urban Tech Guerilla

## Dedication

I dedicate the *Urban Tech Guerilla* to Ernesto "Che" Guevara.

Despite having wildly different political ideas, Che has always been an inspiration to me.

A determined fighter who never gave up on liberty, Che has become a symbol of political activism.

Just as his guide inspired people around the world, and as a symbol of political pluralism, I will be writing this new guide, updated for the modern world, for everyone who fights for whatever cause he finds righteous. Because everyone who is willing to sacrifice personal comfort for a cause is worthy of my help.

## Addendum

### Practical Guides

An early draft for a guide on how to make untraceable Internet connections using public Wi-Fi APs. I will certainly try to make it accessible to the average layman.
